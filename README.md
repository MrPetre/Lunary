# Login-Logout-system

1.run npm i
2.change the location for MongoURI

After that, feel free to use this as a very basic login/logout template for a bigger scale project.  That's what I intended to create this repository for.

There's a MongoURI template already created so you can easily connect it to an online database.

Other than that, this was created successfully with Node.js, mongoose, express, MongoDB, and many other npm packages.
